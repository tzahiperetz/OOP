# listNodes test

# Create a graph
created graph g1
created graph g2

# Add a pair of nodes
created node n1 with cost 1
created node n2 with cost 2
created node n3 with cost 3
created node n4 with cost 4
created node n5 with cost 5
created node n6 with cost 6

added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1
added node n3 to g1
added node n4 to g1
added node n5 to g1
added node n6 to g1
added node n1 to g2
added node n2 to g2

# Add an edge
added edge from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge from n1 to n3 in g1
added edge from n1 to n4 in g1
added edge from n1 to n5 in g1
added edge from n1 to n6 in g1
added edge from n2 to n3 in g1
added edge from n2 to n4 in g1
added edge from n2 to n5 in g1
added edge from n2 to n6 in g1
added edge from n4 to n3 in g1
added edge from n4 to n2 in g1
added edge from n4 to n1 in g1
failed to add edge
added edge from n2 to n1 in g1

g1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6
g2 contains: n1 n2
