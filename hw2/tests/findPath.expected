# Create a graph
created graph g1

# Add nodes
created node a with cost 2
created node b with cost 1
created node c with cost 3
created node d with cost 1
created node e with cost 4

added node a to g1
added node b to g1
added node c to g1
added node d to g1
added node e to g1

# Add an edge
added edge from a to b in g1
added edge from a to c in g1
added edge from b to c in g1
added edge from b to d in g1
added edge from c to d in g1
added edge from c to e in g1
added edge from d to e in g1
